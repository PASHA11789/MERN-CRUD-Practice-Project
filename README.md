I built it after completing many tutorails to practice how actually Frontend communcates with Backend. 
It Performs Basic CRUD operations. Everything is run locally. 

->What I learnt from it: 
 - creating APIs to get the UI-SERVER-DATABASE to communicate each other
 - Learnt DB for the first time, how set it up locally.
 - React Router DOM to navigating between pages.
 - React Hot Toast for toast (notifications)
 - Learnt github during this project (so this is why the commits for the backend aren't there. this repo was created after the server was almost created)

-> Technologies for Frontend:

- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router DOM
- Axios
- React Hot Toast
- React Hooks

-> Technologies for Backend:

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Cors
- Dotenv

-> Technologies for Database:

- MongoDB
- Mongoose

-> Tools 

- VS Code Editor
- Nodemon - to keep the server automatically restart, everytime a file is saved
- Git/Github
- Postman
- MongoDB Compass - for local DB GUI
